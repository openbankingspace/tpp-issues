# Open Banking UK - Unofficial TPP issue tracker

**NOTE:** This is a **public** project that is **NOT** affiliated with the [Open Banking Implementation Entity](https://www.openbanking.org.uk/).

This is a place for Open Banking participants to share information on known issues across the Open Banking Ecosystem. The aim is to augment the [:lock: Open Banking Service Desk](https://openbanking.atlassian.net/servicedesk/customer/portal/1) with a public, transparent repository of information shared with all interested parties.

---

**This does not replace the Open Banking Service Desk!** - Currently **ALL** issues **SHOULD** be reported to

* The ASPSP in question directly
* OBIE (via the OBSD)

If, however, TPPs feel that it would benefit the ecosystem they are encouraged to additionally share the information here. 

By doing so, TPPs will be able to collaborate, reducing wasteful duplicated investigations by both TPPs and ASPSPs. By having the issue tracker be public, our hope is that the increased transparency can improve TPP/ASPSP interactions, and give unregulated third parties some insight into the process. We hope this proves useful to a wider audience than the regulated entities that have access to the OBSD.

It is **VITALLY** important that everyone is aware - all content posted here is public to the world. Accordingly, please

* **DO NOT** post sensitive information, such as credentials under any circumstances.
* **DO NOT** post PII, such as resource payloads from PSUs or any other identifiable information
* **DO NOT** post Security Issues or any "sensitive issue" that could impact the security or functionality of the OB platform. 
* **DO** remain professional when reporting issues. This is a public space and antagonising participants or vendors runs counter to the objective of maintaining a repository of actionable information.
* **DO** act in good faith. The aim is to create a repository of known issues/defects/events across OB, not to push any particular agenda.
* **DO** redact or avoid sharing information that you feel would benefit your competitors or that you consider proprietary.

---

By participating, you allow other TPPs to benefit from information sharing. There is no competitive advantage in having the best implementation of an unstable, unadopted system, as such we will all benefit from reduced barriers to entry and faster incident triage if we share issues together.
